							<h2>Teresa &quot;Lady T&quot; McVay</h2>
						</header>
						<p>	I'm new to the Just Inked family and feel blessed to work with some of the most amazing group of people around. I'm 47 years old and live in Perry, Oklahoma.  I'm the mother of 2 boys and they are my heart.<br>
						</p>
						<p>					    I work at our local newspaper in advertising and to say the least I do get those looks by some who see my tattoos as &quot;Why did you do that to your body&quot; but most people are more acceptable of them then not. Things in the business world are changing folks. That's one of my passions is to show people that the old stigma of tattoos are false! One reason for the knuckle tattoos I have that say SKIN DEEP, don't judge people by what's on the skin but what's in the heart. Beauty is only skin deep but the heart of a person is what changes the world. <br>
						  <br>
						  I have only started my dream of the tattoo life about 5 years ago and I'm still going. It's an addiction as you all know.  When I got my first tattoo it was on the back of my neck at someone's house and I love it, flaws and all. Each tattoo is a memory, loss of family, future plans and relationships built. I would never change anyone of them.  I appreciate the imperfect in each one.<br>
						  <br>
					    I'm a huge fan of all things horror, scary and strange. Of course, Halloween is my favorite time of the year! I am a proud Wiccan, what other holiday suites me!!   Blessed Be my new friends!! </p>
